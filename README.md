# The Association Between Religious Fundamentalism and Homophobic Beliefs as mediated by gender, class, and education level.

## Abstract
The morality of same-sex relationships is a controversial topic within American culture. While approval ratings have increased by 24% in the past two decades , the rate of acceptance dropped 7% from 2022 to 2023 (71 to 64% respectively)(Jones, 2023). Previous research on the predictors of homophobia have found an association between religious fundamentalism and homophobic beliefs although this association has not been thoroughly explored. This study, based on data from the 2021 General Social Survey, finds that religious fundamentalism continues to be a significant predictor of homophobia when controlling for class and level of education. Furthermore, findings show that, generally, the presence of homophobic beliefs drops as education and income level increases within the sample.

## Introduction

The morality of same-sex relationships is a controversial topic within American culture. While approval ratings have increased by 24% in the past two decades , the rate of acceptance dropped 7% from 2022 to 2023 (71 to 64% respectively)(Jones, 2023). Monitoring this public opinion gives a good idea of the level of homophobia, defined as negative behaviors or attitudes directed towards LGBT individuals (Renzetti and Edleson, 2008), present within American society. LGBT exposure to homophobic attitudes can lead to internalized homophobia, characterized by feelings of shame and negative self-image (Ventriglio, 2021) which has been associated with negative mental health outcomes, higher risk of suicide, and significant increase in sexual risk behaviors (Ventriglio, 2021). As LGBT individuals constitute a significant minority demographic in the US (7.1% of Americans identify as LGBT as of 2022 (Jones, 2022)), the prevalence of homophobia in US society poses a significant public health risk. In order to better understand the nature of homophobia in the US, it is necessary to explore the relationship between homophobic beliefs and other beliefs, as well as the way that demographics such as gender and class mediate these relationships.

Past research on homophobia has broadly supported the finding that religious fundamentalism is correlated with homophobic beliefs (Nagoshi, 2008). It has also been shown that men on average show more homophobic behavior than women (Schwartz and Lindley, 2005) (Lingiardi, 2005) and that predictors of homophobia, aside from religious fundamentalism, generally differ between the sexes (Nagoshi, 2008). Other predictors of homophobia are contested within this field of research with some studies pointing to level of contact with gay people (Smith, 2009) as well as authoritarianism, sexism, and aggression proneness (Nagoshi, 2008) as predictors. One study which studied the voting results of 28 states who had same-sex marriage related initiatives on the ballot showed that disapproval of same-sex marriage was most present in communities that emphasized traditional gender roles but that this correlation was especially strong in communities defined by a lack of unity, low rates of home ownership, and high crime rates (McVeigh, 2009). 

While past research has mainly focused on identifying beliefs correlated with homophobia and determining how these differ for men and women, not as much attention has been paid to the ways that these beliefs interact for people of differing socioeconomic statuses. McVeigh’s findings (2009) indicate that certain beliefs are stronger predictors within communities defined by factors often present in low-income communities, although this variable is not explicitly explored. This indicates that more attention could be given within this field of research to the variable of class as a mediator between homophobia and religious fundamentalism. Furthermore, as education level is often indicative of class, this variable could also be explored as a mediator. The goals of the present analysis include 1) determining the relationship between religious fundamentalism and homophobia within the sample 2) exploring the relationship between these variables for participants of different sex, class, and education level. 

## Methodology
The General Social Survey (GSS) represents the civilian non-institutionalized population of the United States and monitors “trends in opinions, attitudes, and behaviors”(GSS2021). In the 2021 GSS 4,032 American adults 18 or older were surveyed via online self-administered questionnaire given in both English and Spanish. In this round of the GSS, the response “don’t know” was removed as an option and instead respondents were given the option to skip questions if they wished. These skipped questions represent a significant portion of missing data in the sample, especially with respect to sensitive questions such as the respondents opinion of homosexuality. Consequently the sample which includes respondents who answered all the questions of interest in this study is smaller than the total surveyed, including only 1304 people.

The variables used in this study (homophobia, household income, education level, and fundamentalism of religion) were all collected from the 2021 General Social Survey. The explanatory variables are household income, education level, and fundamentalism of religion with the response variable being homophobia. Homophobia was measured with the question “And what about a man who admits that he is homosexual…Suppose this homosexual wanted to make a speech in your community. Should he be allowed to speak, or not?”. The response “no” was somewhat low in the same (~8%). Household income was measured under the section titled “Inflation adjusted family income”, and was most concentrated in the $30,000-65,000 range. Education level was measured under the section “Respondent’s Degree” and consisted of five categories (less than high school, high school, junior college/associates, bachelors, and graduate). The most common response was high school, followed by bachelors. Fundamentalism of religion was measured with the section “Fundamentalism/Liberalism of Respondent’s Religion” and consisted of three categories (fundamentalist, moderate, liberal). Fundamentalist identification was a less frequent response (15%) compared to moderate (39%) and liberal (39%).

## Results

### Univariate
The response deemed homophobic was low in the sample (~8%).

### Bivariate

As expected, Chi-Squared analysis showed that respondents who identified themselves as fundamentalist were significantly more likely to express homophobic beliefs (19%) compared to those who identified as moderate (6%) or liberal (4%), X2=43.9, 2 df, p<.01 (Figure 1). However, there was not a statistically significant difference between those who identified as moderate and those who identified as liberal p=0.85.

Chi-Squared analysis also showed that generally the presence of homophobia decreased as the highest level of education increased (Figure 2), X2=45.0, 4 df, p<.01, although those with associates degrees were not shown to be statistically different than other education levels p=1 (except < high school, p=0.01) and there was not a significant difference between bachelors and graduate degrees p=1.

Although in the sample, women exhibited more homophobic views than men, Chi-Squared analysis showed this difference to be non-significant, X2=12.8, 3 df, p=0.35.

### Multivariate

Logistic Analysis was used to test multivariate correlations. At each education level, those who identified as fundamentalist exhibited the largest probability of homophobia (Figure 4).
When controlling for education level, religious identification was still significantly correlated with homophobic beliefs, p<0.001. Those who identified as fundamentalist were 3.3x more likely to be homophobic than moderates and 4.8x more likely than liberals **across education level**.

At each income level, the probability of homophobia is highest for fundamentalists with probabilities for moderates and liberals being similarly low (Figure 3).

When controlling for income level, religious identification was still predictive of homophobia. Fundamentalists were 3.2x more likely to be homophobic than moderates and 5x more likely than liberals **across income level**.


## Discussion
In agreement with prior research, fundamentalism is predictive of homophobia regardless of education level or class.
Within this analysis, class and education level respond similarly in relation to homophobia, supporting the hypothesis that these variables are interrelated. 

More research is needed to better understand what characteristics of fundamentalist religious beliefs are associated with homophobia. Addressing key characteristics of these beliefs could be important for elimating these bigoted values.
